# RopenPi

This is a fork of the [open-api-rswag gem](https://github.com/jdanielian/open-api-rswag).
It's a good gem in an early development stage. The original [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag) gem and the open api fork a have one thing in common: they do to much.

There are easier ways to get an instance of the swagger ui running than building it as a rails engine.

In future releases this gem will provide a basic example of how this will look like.

In the mean time this will remain a WIP :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ropen_pi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ropen_pi

## Unsupported

Due to massive changes in the spec, this gem currently does not support any type of collection queries.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

So you have decided to contribute?! This sounds great!
To make it super easy to start the only thing you have to have installed is Docker.
Then you can just use the batteries-included DevContainer for VSCode.

There is a lot of documentation on getting started with this kind of development.
If you are kind of new to this please make sure to read the offical [docs over at Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
