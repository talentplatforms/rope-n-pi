# RopenPi

This is a fork of the [open-api-rswag gem](https://github.com/jdanielian/open-api-rswag).
It's a good gem in an early development stage. The original [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag) gem and the open api fork a have one thing in common: they do to much. 

There are easier ways to get an instance of the swagger ui running than building it as a rails engine. 

In future releases this gem will provide a basic example of how this will look like.

In the mean time this will remain a WIP :)


Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ropen_pi`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ropen_pi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ropen_pi

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
